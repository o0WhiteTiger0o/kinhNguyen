        <h1>The Lord’s Prayer</h1>
	    <p>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.</br>
        Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us;</br>
        and lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>

            Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and in the hour of our death. Amen.</p>

        <h1>The Apostles’ Creed</h1>
	    <p>I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.
            I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended to the dead. On the third day He rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
            
            I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.</p>
